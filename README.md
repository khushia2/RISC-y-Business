# RISC-y-Business
In this project, my team implemented a 5-stage pipeplined RV32I microprocessor in SystemVerilog. The processor is split into the following 5 stages: fetch, decode, execute, memory and write-back with buffers between them.

# Feature Highlights:
* Memory Hierarchy (I-Cache, L1/L2 D-Cache, Arbiter)
* Stalling
* Forwarding Unit
* Tournament Branch Predictor
* Branch Target Buffer
* Stride Prefetcher
